# Overview
This program simulates a text-based game. It is a prototype with one level within it. However, since I still do not know how to play as the user in VS code, I hard coded the player information. Look at the code to see the other possible responses. 

# Development Environment
* Visual Studio Code
* Kotlin (downloaded to VS code)
* assisted JDK (Java)

# Execution
this displays the welcome message that the user would see
