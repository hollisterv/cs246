# Overview
progam that simulates user input for calculating seam allowance to a desired quilt length. I made the input instead of asking the user, since i did not know how to run Kotlin on the terminal. I still have a lot to learn. This program does not deal with error handling. 

# Development Environment
* Visual Studio Code
* Kotlin (downloaded to VS code)
* assisted JDK (Java)

# Execution

Normally, the quilter will know the specifications that they need for the size of quilt they are working on. However, this will help them do some quilt calculations with less work

I add some addtional calculations at the end for fun to display how many rows they will need to make and how many squares they will need to finish the quilt.
